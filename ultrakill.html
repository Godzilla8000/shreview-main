Ultrakill is the first game I look at when designing games because of its philosophy. Fun Beofre Realism.
</p>
<br>Everything in the players kit is built to feel good to use and be used in combination with each other, encouraging you to "break the game" by creatively combining and using your weapons in a variety of ways. The coin is a good early example of this. The secondary pistol lets you throw a coin which when shot with lock onto the nearest enemy and deals good damage. However, certain weapons like the game’s railgun have the ability to hit the coin for even more damage. Skilled players have managed to line up coins and hit them all with one well placed railgun shot.

<br> Another good example is the bug turned feature of being able to parry your own shotgun shells. The parry mechanic in the game is used when an enemy projectile gets close enough to you, deflecting the bullet and healing yourself. However timing your shotgun blast and parry punch at around the same time creates the same effect as a parry (minus the healing). As a developer I think the lesson to be learned here is about fun design. When making a combat system it’s very easy to make a derivative samey game so always try to find something unique to add.

<br> One example of me taking this approach was for a small personal project game I made called Go And Be Tank(UNITY). The player can do three things, move, shoot and parry. With a dash and a charge shot added in. The secret was in the charged shot which slowly moves and deals little damage. However, shooting or parrying this projectile will either make it split into several smaller projectiles or speed up and explode when it collides with anything. Stuff like that can turn even the simplest combat system into something with more options and approaches.
