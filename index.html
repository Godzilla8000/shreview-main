       Stray is the type of game you go to when you need something to cheer you up. What stood out the most to me about Stray was its environment design. The fantastic use of props and the textures convey the dilapidation of the environment in a way that feels real. Coupled with the calm techno soundtrack and the fantastic cat animations creates a game that is both apocalyptic and very cosy.

        The Batman Arkham series was near and dear to my heart growing up so when going back to it I was curious if the game still held up. I think the thing that really stood out to me going through this entry was just how good the shaders and art design was. Every corner of Arkham Asylum feels specifically designed to make you uncomfortable, and the shader that not only makes the game feel comic book-esque but also gritty and grimy. You can feel the dark history of the institution just by walking through its halls and I think that's an achievement.

    <p class = note-style>
        Anyone who knows me knows that Monster Hunter is my favorite series in gaming. Despite the performance issues and simplification of the series core mechanics I think Monster Hunter Wilds excels in its weapon design. In a long running series like Monster Hunter every weapon tells a story. You can watch Greatsword slowly incorporate heavier attacks and impressive finishers into its moveset. Expertly using hitsop for a juicy dopamine hit. Or Insect Glaive welt from a glorified pole vault to a physics defying helicopter weapon now get some floshier combo moves to work towards. It's iteration that has let the combat become as good as it is and shows the importance of a dev team that listens to its community.

    <p class = note-style>
       I have a tendency to like games that do something new. Shadows of Doubt is a specific game that scratches a specific itch. It just so happens that the itch of being a private detective solving a series of randomly generated murders in a randomly generated town is really cool! Some jankiness aside the unique voxel style, 70's inspired interiors and living breathing world create a game world which I adored learning inside and out.
